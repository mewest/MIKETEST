%MASTERCORR_EXTRACT extract matches to the master waveform
% [MATCH] = MASTERCORR_EXTRACT(W) reads waveform W and produces a
% structure MATCH which contains relevent information for each successful
% match with the master waveform snippet.This function is intended
% to follow MASTERCORR_SCAN. In order to function properly, the properties
% MASTERCORR_TRIG, MASTERCORR_CORR and masterCORR_SNIPPET must exist in W.
% See MASTERCORR_SCAN for description of these fields. MATCH is a
% structure containing fields:
%   trig (double)           : trigger times in Matlab data format
%   corrValue (double)      : peak correlation value (<=1.0) 
%   corrValueAdj (double)   : max. correlation of an adjacent peak
%   network (cell)          : network code
%   station (cell)          : station code    
%   channel (cell)          : channel code
%   location (cell)         : network code
%
% [MATCH,C] = MASTERCORR_EXTRACT(W) produces a correlation object containing
% segmented waveforms extracted from waveform W. 
%
% [MATCH,C] = MASTERCORR_EXTRACT(W,PRETRIG,POSTRIG) Same as above, however, the
% data window width and alignment is determined explicitly by the fields
% PRETRIG and POSTTRIG. These values are given in seconds relative to the
% trigger times in MASTERCORR_TRIG. If not specified, these values are
% inferred from the time fields in TRIGGER, START and END contained in
% MASTERCORR_SNIPPET.
%
% [MATCH,C] = MASTERCORR_EXTRACT(W,..,THRESHOLD) allows a minimum correlation
% threshold to be included. This is useful if only the highest quality
% waveforms need to be extracted fro ma more permissive scan of the data.
%
% *** NOTE ABOUT MULTIPLE WAVEFORMS ***
% This function is designed to accept NxM waveform matrices as input. The
% output is a single correlation object containing the segmented waveforms
% from each element of W. This is useful, for example, when W is a 24x1
% matrix of hourly waveforms. However, unexpected (or clever!) results may
% be produced when W is complicated by elements with different channels or
% master waveform snippets. For some uses it may prove wise to pass only
% selected elements of W to this function. For example:
% C = MASTERCORR_EXTRACT(W(1:5)) Note that it is also possible to produce
% massive correlation objects. Correlation objects exceeding 10,000
% waveforms have been successfully manipulated. As a rule however, be aware
% that downstream processing time goes up considerably as correlation
% objects climb grow to thousands of events.
%
% See also mastercorr_scan, mastercorr_plot_stats, correlation,
